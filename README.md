# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
This analysis uses Python's Matplotlib to create a visualization of ride-sharing data. The analysis will separate the data into Rural, Urban, and Suburban city types and show the unique differences. 
## Results
![Data Summary](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmsuarez1997/PyBer_Analysis/main/analysis/Summary_df.png)

Urban city types have the highest total rides and drivers, and rural city types have the lowest total rides and drivers. Urban city types have 13 times more total rides and 30.83 times more drivers than rural city types. Urban city types have 2.60 times more total rides and 4.90 times more drivers than suburban city types. 

Urban city types have the highest total fares, and rural ones have the lowest total fares. Urban city types' total fares are 9.20 times bigger than rural city types and 2.06 times bigger than suburban city types. 

Rural city types have the highest average fares per ride at $34.62 per ride, and urban city types have the lowest average fares per ride at $24.53 per ride. Rural city types are 1.11 times more expensive than suburban city types and 1.41 times more expensive than urban ones. 

Rural city types have the highest average fare per driver at $55.49 per ride, and urban city types have the lowest average fares per ride at $16.57 per ride. Rural city types are 1.40 times greater than suburban city types and 3.34 times greater than urban ones.

## Summary
There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

I recomend increasing the number of drivers in rurual city types either with advertisement or cash incentives. The average fares per driver in rural cites is 3.34 times higher than urban city types. This is an indication that you may need more drivers.
