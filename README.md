# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
This analysis uses Python's Matplotlib to create a visualization of ride-sharing data. The analysis will separate the data into Rural, Urban, and Suburban city types and show the unique differences. 
## Results
![Data Summary](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmsuarez1997/PyBer_Analysis/main/analysis/Summary_df.png)

Urban city types have the highest total rides and drivers, and rural city types have the lowest total rides and drivers. Urban city types have 13 times more total rides and 30.83 times more drivers than rural city types. Urban city types have 2.60 times more total rides and 4.90 times more drivers than suburban city types. 

Urban city types have the highest total fares, and rural ones have the lowest total fares. Urban city types' total fares are 9.20 times bigger than rural city types and 2.06 times bigger than suburban city types. 

Rural city types have the highest average fares per ride at $34.62 per ride, and urban city types have the lowest average fares per ride at $24.53 per ride. Rural city types are 1.11 times more expensive than suburban city types and 1.41 times more expensive than urban ones. 

Rural city types have the highest average fare per driver at $55.49 per ride, and urban city types have the lowest average fares per ride at $16.57 per ride. Rural city types are 1.40 times greater than suburban city types and 3.34 times greater than urban ones.

## Summary
I recommend increasing the number of drivers in rural city types either with advertisements or cash incentives. In rural cities, the average fare per driver is 3.34 times higher than in urban city types. This indicates more drivers are needed. 

The second recommendation is to increase the fares in rural areas to incentivize more drivers. The prices between suburban and urban city types are only 1.11 and 1.41, respectively, which is lower than expected when comparing the difference in average fare per driver.  

Lastly, I recommend lowering the fare price for suburban customers to incentivize more customers to request rides. Hopefully, lowering costs in the short term will get new people to use the app, and that will, in the long term, increase the total revenue.
